    <h2>About CTF-CHALLENGE</h2>
    <p>Capture The Flag (CTF) is a dynamic cybersecurity competition
        designed to simulate real-world security challenges. In CTF events,
        participants leverage their skills in various areas such as penetration
        testing, binary exploitation, forensics, cryptography, and
        steganography to strategically locate hidden flags. These flags
        represent vulnerabilities or secrets that need to be discovered and
        exploited. CTFs offer a hands-on learning experience, allowing
        participants to apply their technical knowledge in solving complex
        cybersecurity puzzles. With progressive difficulty levels and
        competitive formats, CTFs cater to a wide range of skill sets,
        encouraging continuous learning and fostering teamwork.

        everyone and induct the beginners into cybersecurity and
        encourage secure coding practices through hands-on
        learning in the form of CTF (Capture The Flag) Events.</p>
        <p>Uniqueness: CTFs stand out for their hands-on approach,
